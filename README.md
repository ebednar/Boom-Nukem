## Doom_Nukem

> Desctiption
> 
> This project is final project in first graphic branch of School 21 (Ecole 42). There we made
> a game engine, similar with Doom and Duke Nukem 3d. This is much harder to understand and to
> code also engine than Wolf3d. We have manage with walls set in gamespace with float numbers, which
> makes it render, collision and texturing really fun (not really fun when facing it first time).
> When the render was ready, the real fun started: gameplay, animations, enemies, level design, sounds,
> HUD, inventory and other stuff. It was easy to add, but put the perception of game to next level.
> In current state, the game is not very interesting to play, but shows all the engine features.
> To make a real game of that, one must only expand current resources.

Also there are light control tools, and the gameplay uses it as well - enemies move faster in darker rooms, and slower in lighter - and you can turn on and off the light in room using switches:
